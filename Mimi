    <h2>Chapter 1: The Beginning</h2>
    <p>From the moment we met, something sparked inside me—a quiet but powerful pull toward you, Mimi. Our journey began with smiles, laughter, and the nervous joy of discovering each other. Even though distance stretched between us, our hearts found a way to meet every day. I still remember our first late-night talks, the way you made me feel seen, understood, and cared for. You gave me something rare and precious—love, pure and beautiful.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 2: The Challenges</h2>
    <p>Long-distance is never easy, yet you stood by me through every lonely night, every petty argument, and every moment of doubt. You were patient when I was overthinking, calm when I was jealous, and kind when I was childish. Your love never wavered. Even when I felt like giving up on myself, you didn’t give up on us. And for that, I am endlessly grateful. You reminded me what it means to fight for love that’s real.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h2>Chapter 3: My Promise</h2>
    <p>Mimi, I promise that one day, the oceans won’t keep us apart. I will build a future where we can wake up beside each other, hold hands without screens between us, and laugh in the same room. Until that day comes, I’ll keep loving you with everything I am. I’ll grow, I’ll learn, and I’ll be the man you believe in. This love—our love—is worth every mile, every tear, and every second of waiting. Always yours, no matter where, no matter when.</p>
